Scouts who want fastest path to value

Limitations:

Doesn't work with Claude Desktop yet (use local for that)
No direct CLI execution
Requires dbt Starter+ plan (included in free trial)

Original: Local dbt MCP Server
Still required for:

Claude Desktop integration (this tutorial's focus)
Cursor, Claude Code
Local development workflows
Direct CLI command execution

Choose Remote if: You want to build a web demo quickly with minimal setup
Choose Local if: You're using Claude Desktop or need CLI tools

Note: This tutorial focuses on the local server for Claude Desktop integration. For remote server setup, see the addendum at the end.


Part 1: Set Up Your dbt Project
Step 1.1: Create a Sample dbt Project
If you don't have an existing dbt project, let's create a simple one:
bash# Create a new dbt project
pip install dbt-core dbt-snowflake  # Or your warehouse adapter
dbt init my_analytics_project
cd my_analytics_project
Step 1.2: Define Sample Models
Create a simple staging model in models/staging/stg_orders.sql:
sql-- models/staging/stg_orders.sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}

SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    status,
    total_amount
FROM {{ source('raw', 'orders') }}
Create a mart model in models/marts/fct_orders.sql:
sql-- models/marts/fct_orders.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    status,
    total_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount 
        ELSE 0 
    END as revenue
FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
Step 1.3: Push to dbt Cloud

Create a new project in dbt Cloud
Connect your Git repository
Configure your data warehouse connection
Run dbt build to create your models


Part 2: Configure the Semantic Layer
Step 2.1: Create Semantic Models
Create models/marts/semantic_models.yml:
yamlsemantic_models:
  - name: orders
    description: Order fact table with key business metrics
    model: ref('fct_orders')
    
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
    
    entities:
      - name: order
        type: primary
        expr: order_id
      - name: customer
        type: foreign
        expr: customer_id
    
    dimensions:
      - name: order_date
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: status
        type: categorical
    
    measures:
      - name: order_count
        agg: count
        expr: order_id
      - name: total_revenue
        agg: sum
        expr: revenue
      - name: average_order_value
        agg: average
        expr: total_amount
Step 2.2: Define Business Metrics
Create models/marts/metrics.yml:
yamlmetrics:
  - name: revenue
    description: Total revenue from completed orders
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: total_revenue
    
  - name: monthly_revenue
    description: Revenue grouped by month
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: total_revenue
    config:
      time_granularity: month
    
  - name: order_count
    description: Total number of orders
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: order_count
    
  - name: aov
    description: Average order value
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: average_order_value
    
  - name: revenue_growth_mom
    description: Month-over-month revenue growth
    type: derived
    type_params:
      expr: (monthly_revenue - monthly_revenue_prev) / monthly_revenue_prev
      metrics:
        - name: monthly_revenue
          alias: monthly_revenue_prev
          offset_window: 1 month
Step 2.3: Deploy Semantic Layer

In dbt Cloud, navigate to Account Settings → Projects
Select your project and go to Settings → Semantic Layer
Configure your Semantic Layer:

Enable the Semantic Layer
Set up the proxy connection
Note your Environment ID




Part 3: Install and Configure dbt MCP Server
Step 3.1: Install Required Tools
bash# Install uv (Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or on macOS
brew install uv

# Install the dbt MCP server
pip install dbt-mcp
Note: Working Without Semantic Layer API Access
If you don't have Semantic Layer API access (no trial or paid plan), you can still use the dbt MCP server with limited functionality:
What WILL work without Semantic Layer:

✅ Discovery tools (list models, view lineage, get metadata)
✅ CLI execution tools (run, test, compile commands)
✅ Reading project documentation
✅ Exploring model definitions and SQL

What WON'T work without Semantic Layer:

❌ Querying metrics through the API
❌ Using query_metrics tool
❌ Semantic Layer integrations (BI tools)

To disable Semantic Layer tools in your config:
envDISABLE_SEMANTIC_LAYER_TOOLS=true
This way you can still learn and experiment with most MCP features!
Step 3.2: Get Your dbt Cloud Credentials

Get your Account ID:

Go to dbt Cloud → Account Settings
Copy the Account ID from the URL: cloud.getdbt.com/settings/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/


Get your User ID:

Go to Profile Settings
Find your User ID in the URL


Create a Service Token:

Go to Account Settings → Service Tokens
Create a new token with these permissions:

Metadata Only (minimum for discovery)
Semantic Layer Only (for querying metrics)
Job Admin (if you want to run dbt commands)




Get Environment IDs:

Go to Deploy → Environments
Copy the IDs for both Production and Development environments



Step 3.3: Create Configuration Files
Create .env file in your home directory (~/.dbt-mcp.env):
env# dbt Cloud Configuration
DBT_HOST=cloud.getdbt.com
DBT_ACCOUNT_ID=12345  # Your actual account ID
DBT_USER_ID=67890      # Your actual user ID
DBT_TOKEN=dbtc_xxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Your service token

# Environment IDs
DBT_PROD_ENV_ID=111111  # Your production environment ID
DBT_DEV_ENV_ID=222222   # Your development environment ID

# Optional: Local project path for hybrid setup
DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/Users/yourname/projects/my_analytics_project

# Tool Access Control (optional)
# Uncomment to disable specific tool categories
# DISABLE_SEMANTIC_LAYER_TOOLS=false
# DISABLE_DISCOVERY_TOOLS=false
# DISABLE_CLI_TOOLS=false

Part 4: Connect Claude Desktop
Step 4.1: Locate Claude Configuration
Find your Claude configuration file:
macOS:
bashopen ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/
Windows:
%APPDATA%\Claude\
Linux:
bash~/.config/Claude/
Step 4.2: Configure MCP Server
Edit claude_desktop_config.json:
json{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbt-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/Users/yourname/.dbt-mcp.env",
        "dbt-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Alternative configuration using direct path:
json{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbt-mcp": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uvx",
      "args": [
        "--env-file",
        "/Users/yourname/.dbt-mcp.env",
        "dbt-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Step 4.3: Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q on Mac, Alt+F4 on Windows)
Restart the application
Check for MCP connection indicator in the interface


Part 5: Test Your Setup
Test 1: Basic Connection
Ask Claude:

"Can you connect to my dbt project and tell me what models are available?"

Expected: Claude should list your dbt models.
Test 2: Semantic Layer Query
Ask Claude:

"What was our total revenue last month?"

Expected: Claude should query the revenue metric through the Semantic Layer.
Test 3: Model Discovery
Ask Claude:

"Show me the lineage for the fct_orders model"

Expected: Claude should show upstream dependencies.
Test 4: Complex Analysis
Ask Claude:

"Compare our month-over-month revenue growth for the last 6 months and identify any trends"

Expected: Claude should use the revenue_growth_mom metric and provide analysis.
Test 5: SQL Generation
Ask Claude:

"Generate the SQL to calculate customer lifetime value using our semantic layer definitions"

Expected: Claude should generate SQL based on your semantic models.

💼 Making the Case to Your Organization: A Scout's Playbook

For the scouts, champions, and unpaid salespeople who are learning this on their own time to bring innovation to their organizations - this section is for you.

The Scout's Journey: From Learning to Implementation
You're not just learning a tool; you're de-risking a significant technology decision for your organization. This section helps you document your journey in a way that builds an undeniable business case.
Phase 1: Document Everything During Your Trial (Days 1-7)
Create Your Evidence Portfolio
1. The "Before" Baseline
Document your current pain points with timestamps and screenshots:
markdown## Current State Pain Points
- **Time to answer "What was revenue last quarter?"**: 45 minutes
  - 10 min: Find the right table
  - 15 min: Write SQL query  
  - 10 min: Verify calculation logic
  - 10 min: Format for stakeholder
- **Inconsistency issues**: Screenshot 3 different revenue calculations from different teams
- **Backlog**: 47 ad-hoc data requests in queue
- **Recurring questions**: Same 20 questions asked every week
2. The "After" Transformation
Record every win with the new setup:
markdown## With Claude + dbt Semantic Layer
- **Same revenue question**: 10 seconds
  - Simply asked: "What was revenue last quarter?"
  - Claude queried the governed metric
  - Returned accurate, consistent answer
- **Complex analysis**: "Compare revenue by segment with MoM growth" - 30 seconds
- **Self-service achieved**: Business user answered their own question
3. The ROI Calculation Spreadsheet
Current State Costs (Annual):
- Data analyst time on ad-hoc requests: 20 hrs/week × $75/hr × 52 weeks = $78,000
- Business decision delays: 2 days average × 50 decisions × $5,000/day = $500,000  
- Inconsistent metrics leading to wrong decisions: [1 example = $XX,000]
- Multiple BI tool licenses: $50,000
Total: ~$628,000+

Proposed Solution Costs (Annual):
- dbt Cloud Team plan: $100/user/month × 10 users = $12,000
- Implementation time (one-time): 80 hours × $100/hr = $8,000
- Training: 20 hours × 10 people × $50/hr = $10,000
Total Year 1: $30,000
Ongoing: $12,000/year

ROI: 2,093% / Payback period: 2.3 weeks
Phase 2: Build Your Proof of Concept (Days 8-12)
The "Wow" Demo Components
1. The Executive Dashboard Question
Record a video showing:

Executive asks: "Why did our Northeast region underperform last quarter?"
You ask Claude the exact question
Claude queries semantic layer, analyzes trends, identifies issues
Time elapsed: 45 seconds vs. 2-day analysis

2. The Consistency Problem Solver
Screenshot series showing:

Old way: 3 teams, 3 different profit margins (24.5%, 31.2%, 27.8%)
New way: Everyone queries same semantic layer metric (27.8%)
Impact: No more arguing about whose numbers are right

3. The Self-Service Victory
Record a non-technical user:

Marketing manager asks Claude: "Which campaigns drove the most revenue?"
Gets answer without SQL knowledge
Follows up with: "Show me the trend over the last 6 months"
Previously impossible without analyst help

📡 Addendum: Remote dbt MCP Server Setup
For scouts who want the fastest path to a demo, here's how to use the remote server:
Prerequisites

dbt Cloud account (free trial works!)
Basic Python knowledge for building a simple client

Step 1: No Installation Needed!
The remote server is already running at dbt Labs. You just need your credentials.
Step 2: Authentication Setup
Instead of environment variables, use HTTP headers:
pythonimport requests
import json

# Your dbt Cloud credentials
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_DBT_TOKEN",
    "X-DBT-ACCOUNT-ID": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
    "X-DBT-ENVIRONMENT-ID": "YOUR_ENV_ID",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Remote MCP endpoint (example - check docs for actual URL)
MCP_ENDPOINT = "https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/mcp"
Step 3: Make Your First Request
python# List available tools
def list_tools():
    request = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "tools/list",
        "id": 1
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{MCP_ENDPOINT}/mcp",
        headers=headers,
        json=request
    )
    
    return response.json()

# Query a metric
def query_metric(metric_name):
    request = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
            "name": "query_metrics",
            "arguments": {
                "metrics": [metric_name]
            }
        },
        "id": 2
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{MCP_ENDPOINT}/mcp",
        headers=headers,
        json=request
    )
    
    return response.json()
Step 4: Build a Simple Web Demo
Create a minimal Flask app that your team can access:
pythonfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return '''
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Ask About Our Data</h1>
            <input type="text" id="question" placeholder="What was revenue last quarter?">
            <button onclick="askQuestion()">Ask</button>
            <div id="answer"></div>
            
            <script>
            async function askQuestion() {
                const question = document.getElementById('question').value;
                const response = await fetch('/ask', {
                    method: 'POST',
                    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
                    body: JSON.stringify({question: question})
                });
                const data = await response.json();
                document.getElementById('answer').innerText = data.answer;
            }
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    '''

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    question = request.json['question']
    # Use remote MCP to answer question
    # This is where you'd integrate with the MCP server
    answer = query_via_mcp(question)
    return jsonify({'answer': answer})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 5: Deploy and Demo

Deploy to a simple platform (Replit, Heroku, or even local ngrok)
Share the URL with stakeholders
Let them ask questions directly
No installation required on their end!

Advantages for Scouts
The remote server is perfect for scouts because:

Zero installation friction - Works immediately
Shareable demos - Send a URL, not installation instructions
Corporate-friendly - No "can't install Python" blockers
Production-preview - What you demo is close to what you'd deploy
Faster iteration - Change and redeploy without reinstalling

Current Limitations

No Claude Desktop support yet - Use local server for that
No CLI tools - Can't run dbt build/test commands
Beta status - Features still being added

Building Your Business Case While Learning
As you work through this tutorial with trial/educational access, document everything for your organization's decision-makers:
What to Capture:

Time Savings:

How long does it take to answer a business question with vs. without the Semantic Layer?
Screenshot Claude answering complex data questions instantly


Consistency Wins:

Show how the same metric calculated differently across teams
Demonstrate unified definitions through the Semantic Layer


Self-Service Analytics:

Record non-technical users querying data through Claude
Document reduced load on data team


Cost Comparison:

Current: Multiple BI tools with duplicate logic
Proposed: Single semantic layer serving all tools
ROI calculation template



Create These Deliverables:

5-minute demo video showing Claude + dbt MCP in action
One-page executive summary with key benefits
Technical architecture diagram showing integration
Pilot project proposal with timeline and success metrics

Overcoming the Chicken-Egg Problem:

Start with free trials to learn
Build a compelling proof of concept
Present to stakeholders with real examples
Request pilot project budget
Expand from successful pilot to full implementation

Remember: You're not just learning a tool - you're becoming the bridge between new technology and organizational adoption. Your learning journey IS the business case.
