## Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Multi-Source Data Integration (System Design)

**Setup:**
"Danaher has 15 operating companies, each with their own Salesforce org and Oracle EBS instance. We need a unified view of customer data across all companies for enterprise reporting. Design the data pipeline architecture."

**What to listen for:**
- Discusses source heterogeneity (different Salesforce schemas, Oracle versions)
- Mentions ingestion tool selection (Fivetran for Salesforce, custom for Oracle)
- Addresses data quality and master data management
- Proposes ELT pattern with Snowflake as target
- Suggests dbt for transformations and unification logic
- Considers incremental loading strategies
- Discusses data governance and access controls

**Follow-up questions:**
- "How would you handle schema changes in one of the Salesforce orgs?"
- "What if two companies have different definitions of 'active customer'?"
- "How do you ensure data quality across disparate sources?"

**Red flags:**
- Jumps straight to PySpark without considering warehouse-native tools
- Doesn't ask about data volumes or SLAs
- Ignores data quality and governance
- Proposes overly complex architecture

**Strong answer signals:**
- Starts with questions (data volumes, SLAs, schema consistency)
- Recommends Fivetran + Snowflake + dbt pattern
- Discusses trade-offs explicitly
- Mentions master data management for customer unification
- Considers operational burden on team

---

### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization (Problem Diagnosis)

**Setup:**
"A critical pipeline that processes daily transaction data is taking 6 hours to complete, up from 2 hours last month. The pipeline reads from S3, transforms with PySpark in Databricks, and loads to Snowflake. Business needs it done in under 2 hours. How do you approach this?"

**What to listen for:**
- Asks clarifying questions (data volume growth? schema changes? code changes?)
- Discusses diagnostic approach (Spark UI, query profiling, data skew analysis)
- Questions whether PySpark is necessary or if transformation can move to Snowflake
- Considers partition strategy and file formats
- Discusses incremental processing vs full reprocessing

**Follow-up questions:**
- "You find that 80% of time is spent in a single groupBy operation. What do you investigate?"
- "Data volume is actually the same. What else could cause slowdown?"
- "What if we moved all transformations to Snowflake - pros and cons?"

**Red flags:**
- Immediately suggests adding more compute without diagnosis
- Doesn't question whether PySpark is the right tool
- Focuses only on code optimization, ignores architecture
- No systematic diagnostic approach

**Strong answer signals:**
- Systematic diagnosis: profile first, optimize second
- Questions architectural assumptions ("Should this be PySpark at all?")
- Discusses cost/performance trade-offs
- Proposes incremental improvement plan
- Mentions monitoring and alerting for future detection

---

### Scenario 3: Tool Selection Decision (Strategic Thinking)

**Setup:**
"We're starting a new project to build a customer 360 view. Data is in Snowflake. The team knows SQL well but has limited Python experience. Some engineers are pushing for a PySpark + Databricks solution 'because it scales better.' What's your recommendation?"

**What to listen for:**
- Asks about data volumes and growth projections
- Considers team skill set and learning curve
- Discusses Snowflake's capabilities (virtual warehouses, scaling)
- Recommends dbt for warehouse-based transformations
- Frames decision around maintainability and team productivity
- Addresses when PySpark would actually be needed

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What if data volumes reach 1TB daily?"
- "Engineers argue Spark is 'future-proof.' How do you respond?"
- "When WOULD you choose Databricks + PySpark for this use case?"

**Red flags:**
- Chooses technology based on "what's cool" rather than fit
- Ignores team capabilities
- Doesn't consider total cost of ownership
- Can't articulate clear criteria for tool selection

**Strong answer signals:**
- Recommends dbt given: warehouse location, team skills, use case
- Articulates clear decision criteria
- Discusses when to revisit decision (e.g., if moving to lake)
- Balances technical excellence with team reality
- Mentions "right tool for the job" philosophy

### Scenario 4: Data Quality Issue (Problem Diagnosis)

**Setup:**
"The CFO reports that yesterday's revenue dashboard shows 5% lower than expected. Finance confirmed the numbers are wrong. The pipeline ran successfully with no errors. How do you investigate?"

**What to listen for:**
- Systematic approach to finding root cause
- Discusses reconciliation between source and target
- Checks for: duplicates, nulls, timezone issues, date boundaries
- Considers data lineage - which upstream system is source of truth?
- Proposes validation checks to prevent future issues
- Communicates urgency and impact understanding

**Follow-up questions:**
- "You find target has correct count but wrong sum. What does that tell you?"
- "How would you prevent this from happening again?"
- "Who do you involve in the investigation?"

**Red flags:**
- Blames source data without investigation
- No systematic diagnostic approach
- Doesn't propose preventative measures
- Fails to communicate impact and timeline

**Strong answer signals:**
- Structured investigation: counts, sums, duplicates, date ranges
- Uses queries to validate each transformation step
- Proposes automated validation checks
- Considers communication plan (CFO waiting for answer)
- Discusses post-incident review

---

### Scenario 5: Real-Time Requirements (System Design)

**Setup:**
"Business wants the customer dashboard to reflect data within 5 minutes of transaction instead of current nightly batch. What are the options and trade-offs?"

**What to listen for:**
- Clarifies "near real-time" definition (5 min vs 1 min vs seconds)
- Discusses multiple approaches: increased batch frequency, CDC, streaming
- Compares complexity vs benefit
- Considers Snowflake Streams vs Kafka vs batch frequency
- Addresses cost implications
- Recommends starting simple, scaling complexity as needed

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What if they really need sub-minute latency?"
- "How does this decision affect the data quality checks we have today?"
- "What's the cost difference between these approaches?"

**Red flags:**
- Immediately jumps to Kafka + Spark Streaming (most complex)
- Doesn't clarify requirements
- Ignores cost and operational burden
- No incremental approach

**Strong answer signals:**
- Clarifies actual requirements (5 min might be "good enough" with hourly batch)
- Proposes tiered options: simple â†’ complex
- Discusses operational complexity and team skills
- Mentions Snowflake Streams as warehouse-native option
- Recommends MVP approach with clear upgrade path

## Interview Style Guidelines

**As the interviewer (CTO), you should:**

1. **Start conversational:** "Tell me about a time you designed a data pipeline for multiple sources."

2. **Go deep on one scenario:** Better to explore trade-offs deeply than skim multiple topics.

3. **Test judgment, not memorization:** Care about reasoning more than syntax.

4. **Ask about trade-offs:** "What are the downsides of that approach?"

5. **Challenge assumptions:** "Why not just use X instead?"

6. **Listen for pragmatism:** Best answer isn't most complex - it's most appropriate.

7. **Time management:** 30 minutes = 2 scenarios maximum, leave time for candidate questions.

**Positive signals to reward:**
- Asks clarifying questions before proposing solution
- Discusses trade-offs explicitly
- Considers team capabilities and operational burden
- Frames technical decisions in business context
- Admits uncertainty but proposes investigation approach
- Knows when to use simple vs complex solutions

**Red flags to probe:**
- Over-engineers solutions
- Doesn't ask questions
- Ignores team/operational constraints
- Can't articulate decision criteria
- Focuses on tools they know rather than right tool for job

## Sample Interview Opening

**Interviewer:** "Thanks for joining, [Candidate Name]. I'm Chris Wheeler, Interim CTO here at Danaher. I've reviewed your background - looks like you have strong experience with data engineering and warehousing. Today I'd like to walk through a couple of scenarios we're facing and get your thoughts on how you'd approach them. Sound good?"

**[Wait for response]**

**Interviewer:** "Great. Let me paint a picture of our environment first. We're a life sciences company with 15 operating companies, each running their own systems - Salesforce for CRM, Oracle EBS or SAP for ERP, various other systems. We've standardized on Snowflake as our enterprise data warehouse, and we're increasingly using dbt for transformations. We also have Databricks for some of our data science work, though most Analytics Engineering happens in Snowflake."

**[Pause to see if candidate asks questions]**

**Interviewer:** "Here's the first scenario I'd like your thoughts on..."
